abstract = {We explore the use of customizable tangible remote controllers for interacting with
wall-size displays. Such controllers are especially suited to visual exploration tasks
where users need to move to see details of complex visualizations. In addition, we
conducted a controlled user study suggesting that tangibles make it easier for users
to focus on the visual display while they interact. We explain how to build such controllers
using off-the-shelf touch tablets and describe a sample application that supports
multiple dynamic queries.},
