	abstract={We present an interaction model for beyond-desktop visualizations 
		that combines the visualization reference model with the instrumental 
		interaction paradigm. Beyond-desktop visualizations involve a wide 
		range of emerging technologies such as wall-sized displays, 3D and 
		shape-changing displays, touch and tangible input, and physical
		information visualizations. While these technologies allow for 
		new forms of interaction, they are often studied in isolation. New 
		conceptual models are needed to build a coherent picture of what has 
		been done and what is possible. We describe a modified pipeline model 
		where raw data is processed into a visualization and then rendered 
		into the physical world. Users can explore or change data by directly 
		manipulating visualizations or through the use of instruments. 
		Interactions can also take place in the physical world outside the 
		visualization system, such as when using locomotion to inspect a 
		large scale visualization. Through case studies we illustrate how 
		this model can be used to describe both conventional and unconventional 
		interactive visualization systems, and compare different design alternatives.}
