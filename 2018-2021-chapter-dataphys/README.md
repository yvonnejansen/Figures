  abstract={Data physicalization is a rich and vast research area that 
  	studies the use of physical artifacts to convey data. It overlaps 
  	with a number of research areas including information visualization, 
  	scientific visualization, visual analytics, tangible user interfaces, 
  	shape-changing interfaces, personal fabrication interfaces, as well 
  	as graphic design, architecture, and art. This chapter surveys 
  	academic work on data physicalization up to 2018, and also provides 
  	a brief overview of non-academic work. It discusses how data 
  	physicalization has been used for analytical purposes, for 
  	communication and education, for accessibility, for self-reflection
  	and self-expression, and finally for enjoyment and meaning. It also 
  	discusses enabling technologies, reviews empirical studies, and 
  	surveys models and theories of data physicalization.}
