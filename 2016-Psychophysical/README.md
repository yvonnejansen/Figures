	abstract={Physical visualizations, or data physicalizations, encode data 
		in attributes of physical shapes. Despite a considerable body of work
		on visual variables, “physical variables” remain poorly understood. 
		One of them is physical size. A difficulty for solid elements is that
		“size” is ambiguous - it can refer to either length/diameter, surface,
		or volume. Thus, it is unclear for designers of physicalizations 
		how to effectively encode quantities in physical size. To investigate,
		we ran an experiment where participants estimated ratios between 
		quantities represented by solid bars and spheres. Our results suggest 
		that solid bars are compared based on their length, consistent with 
		previous findings for 2D and 3D bars on	flat media. But for spheres, 
		participants' estimates are rather proportional to their surface. 
		Depending on the estimation method used, judgments are rather consis-
		tent across participants, thus the use of perceptually-optimized size
		scales seems possible. We conclude by discussing implications for the
		design of data physicalizations and the need for more empirical stu-
		dies on physical variables.}
