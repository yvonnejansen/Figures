abstract = {The concept of power pose originates from a Psychology study from 2010 which suggested 
that holding an expansive pose can change hormone levels and increase risk-taking behavior. Follow-up
experiments suggested that expansive poses incidentally imposed by the design of an environment lead
to more dishonest behaviors. While multiple replication attempts of the 2010 study failed, the follow-
up experiments on incidental postures have so far not been replicated. As UI design in HCI can 
incidentally lead to expansive body postures, we attempted two conceptual replications: we first asked
44 participants to tap areas on a wall-sized display and measured their self-reported sense of power; 
we then asked 80 participants to play a game on a large touch-screen and measured risk-taking. Based on 
Bayesian analyses we find that incidental power poses had little to no effect on our measures but could 
cause physical discomfort. We conclude by discussing our findings in the context of theory-driven 
research in HCI.},
