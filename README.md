# Figures
This repository is dedicated to provide creative commons versions of figures from my articles. I created this repository in an effort to facilitate the reuse of material from my articles, for others and myself. It's a work in progress and I'll keep adding more in the future.

# How to use this repository
Each sub-directory contains an individual README.md file which indicates how to attribute the images of that sub-directory. You may reuse any of these images in your own articles under the condition that you indicate the license of the image and cite the article indicated in the README.md file for the image. You can use that README.md file and the respository address as proof of permission for your publisher; there is no need to ask me or my co-authors explicitly. Nonetheless, we are always happy to learn that our work is useful to others, and we would be happy to hear from you if you choose to reuse any of the material provided here.
